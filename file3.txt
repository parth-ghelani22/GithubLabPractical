Core Concepts and Features
Repositories: These are the central storage spaces for project files and code.
Branches: Developers use branches to create isolated copies of the main codebase to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main, stable version of the project.
Commits: Changes made locally are saved as "commits" with descriptive messages, tracking the history of the project.
Pull Requests (PRs): When changes in a branch are ready to be integrated into the main project, a pull request is opened. This initiates a review process where collaborators can comment, suggest improvements, and approve the changes before they are merged.
Issues: This feature acts as a combination of a to-do list and discussion forum, helping teams track bugs, request features, and manage tasks.
Organizations and Teams: For larger projects or companies, GitHub provides organization accounts to manage group access with granular permissions and roles.
